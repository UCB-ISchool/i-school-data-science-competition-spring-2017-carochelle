Famous for playing comic \"[[dumb blonde]]\" characters, she became one of the most popular [[sex symbol]]s of the 1950s, emblematic of the era's attitudes towards sexuality. Although she was a [[billing (filmmaking)|top-billed]] actress for only a decade, her films grossed $200 million by the time of [[Death of Marilyn Monroe|her unexpected death]] in 1962.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/archives/la-me-marilyn-monroe-19620806-story.html|title=Marilyn Monroe Dies; Pills Blamed|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|date=August 6, 1962|accessdate=September 23, 2015|first1=Howard|last1=Hertel|first2=Don|last2=Heff}}</ref> She continues to be considered a major [[popular culture]] icon.{{sfnm|1a1=Chapman|1y=2001|1pp=542\u2013543|2a1=Hall|2y=2006|2p=468}}\n\nBorn and raised in [[Los Angeles]], Monroe spent most of her childhood in foster homes and an orphanage and married at the age of sixteen. While working in a factory in 1944 as part of the [[United States home front during World War II|war effort]], she was introduced to a photographer from the [[First Motion Picture Unit]] and began a successful [[pin-up model]]ing career. The work led to short-lived film contracts with [[20th Century Fox|Twentieth Century-Fox]] (1946\u201347) and [[Columbia Pictures]] (1948). After a series of minor film roles, she signed a new contract with Fox in 1951. Over the next two years, she became a popular actress with roles in several comedies, including ''[[As Young as You Feel]]'' and ''[[Monkey Business (1952 film)|Monkey Business]]'', and in the dramas ''[[Clash by Night]]'' and ''[[Don't Bother to Knock]]''. Monroe faced a scandal when it was revealed that she had posed for nude photos before becoming a star, but rather than damaging her career, the story increased interest in her films.\n\nBy 1953, Monroe was one of the most marketable Hollywood stars, with leading roles in three films: the [[film noir|noir]] ''[[Niagara (film)|Niagara]]'', which focused on her sex appeal, and the comedies ''[[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953 film)|Gentlemen Prefer Blondes]]'' and ''[[How to Marry a Millionaire]]'', which established her star image as a \"dumb blonde\". Although she played a significant role in the creation and management of her public image throughout her career, she was disappointed at being [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]] and underpaid by the studio. She was briefly suspended in early 1954 for refusing a film project, but returned to star in one of the biggest box office successes of her career, ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]'' (1955). \n\nWhen the studio was still reluctant to change her contract, Monroe founded a film production company in late 1954, Marilyn Monroe Productions (MMP). She dedicated 1955 to building her company and began studying [[method acting]] at the [[Actors Studio]]. In late 1955, Fox awarded her a new contract, which gave her more control and a larger salary. After a critically acclaimed performance in ''[[Bus Stop (1956 film)|Bus Stop]]'' (1956) and acting in the first independent production of MMP, ''[[The Prince and the Showgirl]]'' (1957), she won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Golden Globe for Best Actress]] for ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' (1959). Her last completed film was the drama ''[[The Misfits (film)|The Misfits]]'' (1961).\n\nMonroe's troubled private life received much attention. She struggled with substance abuse, depression, and anxiety. She had two highly publicized marriages, to retired baseball star [[Joe DiMaggio]] and playwright [[Arthur Miller]], both of which ended in divorce. She died at the age of 36 on August 5, 1962, from an overdose of [[barbiturate]]s at her home in Los Angeles. Although Monroe's death was ruled a probable suicide, several [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] have been proposed in the decades following her death.\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===Childhood and first marriage (1926\u20131944)===\n[[File:Marilyn monroe as an infant brightened.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Monroe as an infant, wearing a white dress and sitting on a sheepskin rug|Monroe as an infant]]\n\nMonroe was born Norma Jeane Mortenson at the [[Los Angeles County Hospital]] on June 1, 1926, as the third child of Gladys Pearl Baker (n\u00e9e Monroe, 1902\u201384).{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=3, 13\u201314|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2p=13}} Gladys, the daughter of two poor [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] migrants to California, was a [[flapper]] and worked as a film negative cutter at [[Consolidated Film Industries]].{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=9\u201310|2a1=Rollyson|2y=2014|2pp=26\u201329}} When she was fifteen, Gladys married a man nine years her senior, John Newton Baker, and had two children by him, Robert (1917\u201333){{sfnm|1a1=Miracle|1a2=Miracle|1y=1994|1p=see family tree}} and Berniece (born 1919).{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=7\u20139|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2p=19}} She filed for divorce in 1921, and Baker took the children with him to his native Kentucky.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=7\u20139}} Monroe was not told that she had a sister until she was twelve, and met her for the first time as an adult.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1p=88, for first meeting in 1944|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2p=72, for mother telling Monroe of sister in 1938}} Gladys married her second husband Martin Edward Mortensen in 1924, but they separated before she became pregnant with Monroe; they divorced in 1928.{{sfnm|1a1=Churchwell|1y=2004|1p=150, citing Spoto and Summers|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp= 24\u201325}} The identity of Monroe's father is unknown and Baker was most often used as her surname.{{sfn|Spoto|2001|pp=17, 57}}{{efn|Gladys named Mortensen as Monroe's father in the birth certificate (although the name was misspelled),{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|p=150, citing Spoto, Summers and Guiles}} but it is unlikely that he was the father.{{sfnm|1a1=Churchwell|1y=2004|1pp=149\u2013152|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2p=26|3a1=Spoto|3y=2001|3p=13}} Biographers Fred Guiles and [[Lois Banner]] have stated that her father was most likely Charles Stanley Gifford, a co-worker with whom Gladys had an affair in 1925, whereas [[Donald Spoto]] thinks another co-worker was most likely the father.{{sfnm|1a1=Churchwell|1y=2004|1p=152|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2p=26|3a1=Spoto|3y=2001|3p=13}}}}\n\nMonroe's early childhood was stable and happy.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=17\u201326|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=32\u201335}} While Gladys was mentally and financially unprepared for a child, she was able to place Monroe with foster parents Albert and Ida Bolender in the rural town of [[Hawthorne, California|Hawthorne]] soon after the birth.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=16\u201317|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=164|3a1=Banner|3y=2012|3pp=22\u201332}} They raised their foster children according to the principles of [[evangelicalism|evangelical Christianity]].{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=17\u201326|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=32\u201335}} At first, Gladys lived with the Bolenders and commuted to work in Los Angeles, until longer work shifts forced her to move back to the city in early 1927.{{sfn|Banner|2012|pp=32\u201333}} She then began visiting her daughter on weekends, often taking her to the cinema and to sightsee in Los Angeles.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=17\u201326|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=32\u201335}} Although the Bolenders wanted to adopt Monroe, by the summer of 1933, Gladys felt stable enough for Monroe to move in with her and bought a small house in [[Hollywood]].{{sfn|Banner|2012|1p=35}} They shared it with lodgers, actors George and Maude Atkinson and their daughter, Nellie.{{sfnm|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=26\u201328|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=35\u201339}} Some months later, in January 1934, Gladys had a mental breakdown and was diagnosed with [[paranoid schizophrenia]].{{sfn|Churchwell|2004|pp=155\u2013156}} After several months in a rest home, she was committed to the [[Metropolitan State Hospital (California)|Metropolitan State Hospital]].{{sfnm|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=39\u201340|1a1=Churchwell|1y=2004|1pp=155\u2013156}} She spent the rest of her life in and out of hospitals, and was rarely in contact with Monroe.{{sfnm|2a1=Banner|2y=2012|2pp=39\u201342, 45\u201347, 62, 72, 91, 205|1a1=Spoto|1y=2001|1pp=100\u2013101, 106\u2013107, 215\u2013216}}\n\n{{quote box\n|quote=\"When I was five I think, that's when I started wanting to be an actress.

occupations where \"the woman is on show, there for the pleasure of men.\"{{sfn|Dyer|1986|pp=19, 20}} Film scholar Thomas Harris, who analyzed Monroe's public image in 1957, wrote that her working class roots and lack of family made her appear more sexually available, \"the ideal playmate\", in contrast to her contemporary [[Grace Kelly]], who was also marketed as an attractive blonde, but due to her upper-class background came to be seen as a sophisticated actress, unattainable for the majority of male viewers.{{sfn|Harris|1991|pp=40\u201344}}\n\nAccording to Dyer, Monroe became \"virtually a household name for sex\" in the 1950s and \"her image has to be situated in the flux of ideas about morality and sexuality that characterised the fifties in America\", such as [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]ian ideas about sex, the [[Kinsey Reports|Kinsey report]] (1953), and [[Betty Friedan]]'s ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' (1963).{{sfnm|1a1=Dyer|1y=1986|1p=21|2a1=Dyer|2y=1991|2p=58}} By appearing vulnerable and unaware of her sex appeal, Monroe was the first sex symbol to present sex as natural and without danger, in contrast to the 1940s ''femme fatales''.{{sfn|Dyer|1986|pp=29\u201339}} Spoto likewise describes her as the embodiment of \"the postwar ideal of the American girl, soft, transparently needy, worshipful of men, na\u00efve, offering sex without demands\", which is echoed in [[Molly Haskell]]'s statement that \"she was the fifties fiction, the lie that a woman had no sexual needs, that she is there to cater to, or enhance, a man's needs.\"{{sfnm|1a1=Haskell|1y=1991|1p=256|2a1=Spoto|2y=2001|2p=249}} Monroe's contemporary Norman Mailer wrote that \"Marilyn suggested sex might be difficult and dangerous with others, but ice cream with her\", while [[Groucho Marx]] characterized her as \"Mae West, [[Theda Bara]], and [[Little Bo Peep|Bo Peep]] all rolled into one\".{{sfnm|1a1=Dyer|1y=1986|1p=39|2a1=Churchwell|2y=2004|2p=82}} According to Haskell, due to her status as a sex symbol, Monroe was less popular with women than with men, as they \"couldn't identify with her and didn't support her\", although this would change after her death.{{sfn|Dyer|1986|p=57, quoting Haskell}}\n\nDyer has also argued that platinum blonde hair became such a defining feature of Monroe because it made her \"racially unambiguous\" and exclusively white just as the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954\u201368)|Civil Rights Movement]] was beginning, and that she should be seen as emblematic of racism in twentieth-century popular culture.{{sfn|Dyer|1986|p=40}} Banner agrees that it may not be a coincidence that Monroe launched a trend of platinum blonde actresses during the Civil Rights Movement, but has also criticized Dyer, pointing out that in her highly publicized private life Monroe associated with people who were seen as \"[[white ethnic]]s\", such as Joe DiMaggio ([[Italian-American]]) and Arthur Miller (Jewish).{{sfn|Banner|2012|pp=254\u2013256}} According to Banner, she sometimes challenged prevailing racial norms in her publicity photographs;
